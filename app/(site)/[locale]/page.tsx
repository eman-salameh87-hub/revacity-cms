   * Rendering both put a static banner above the thing built to be the banner,
   * so the slider started halfway down the page behind something it was meant
   * to replace. The generic HeroSection stays for a home page that has no
   * such block — otherwise such a site would open abruptly on body text — so
   * this is "the hero block takes over", not "the banner is gone".
   *
   * Checked against lib/blocks/layout.ts rather than `=== 'slider'`, because
   * `video-hero` is now the other block that means this. Hardcoding one type
   * here is what made the new-aeon.com home page render a placeholder banner
   * above its own video.
